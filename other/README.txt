in order to install the printer on a windows computer:

1) plug printer in using the USB direct cable
2) find printer under Devices and Printers
3) "Update driver" on USCutter
4) select this directory as the driver location, Windows will "do the right
   thing" (gasp)
5) if you are using signblazer elements, note that it will only accept .eps
   files, and that those files must be saved in a really old (like AI 10)
   format, and that when you import them you want to use the "postscript
   scanner", whatever that is


in order to install the printer on a mac computer:
1) install the FTDI drivers for the Keyspan adapter
2) plug the printer's serial cable into the Keyspan adapter
3) plug the Keyspan adapter into a USB port
4) accept that the mac thinks this is a modem (it doesn't hurt anything)
5) in Signcut pro, set the cutter settings to Roland DG/Roland PNC 1000 for
   the cutter type, DO NOT TRY TO USE USCUTTER, IT DOESN'T WORK. also set
   hardware handshake and check all the boxes.
6) signcut pro should work with any reasonable kind of file you give to it
