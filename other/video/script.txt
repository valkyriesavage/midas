We introduce Midas, a software and hardware toolkit to support the design, fabrication, and programming of flexible capacitive touch sensors for interactive objects.

With Midas, designers first define the desired shape, layout, and type of touch sensitive areas in a sensor editor interface.  Midas automatically generates layout files with appropriate sensor pads and routed connections.

These files can be cut out in copper on a vinyl cutter and adhered to the desired prototype object.

Midas supports both record-and-replay actions for existing applications and event output to control novel applications via websockets.
