We introduce Midas, a software and hardware toolkit to support the design, fabrication, and programming of flexible capacitive touch sensors for interactive objects.

With Midas, designers first define the desired shape, layout, and type of touch sensitive areas in a sensor editor interface.

Midas automatically generates a layout file with appropriate sensor pads and routed connections.
[Show the trace view, then the SVG file with thick enough outlines so it's legible]

Designers cut this file from adhesive copper foil on a vinyl cutter and apply it to the desired prototype object.
[Show the vinyl cutter in action; then a quick shot of transfer tape being pulled back]

A vinyl mask layer can prevent stray touch events.

Designers are led through this assembly process by step-by-step instructions that Midas generates.
[Show the web page; scroll it to the bottom, also click on one of the files and show that it opens up.]

Next, designers connect a touch controller board with conductive tape or solder.
[maybe do a split screen video: left-tape; right:soldering - subtitle on soldering: "quick and reliable"]. 

If designers want to experiment with physical sensor placement, they can skip trace routing and attach wires manually. [show someone picking up a sensor and moving it, with a wire sticking out.] 
Designers then use Midas' registration feature to map sensors to their software counterparts.  
[show the sensor registration: click on "register"; cut or pan to touching sensor; show result in UI - highlight the color matching between wire and software with subtitles/callouts/etc]

Midas offers two ways to react to touch events:
Using record-and-replay, the user performs a series of clicking and typing actions
[show start record, some desktop interaction, stop record in software]

Afterwards, Midas will replay that series of actions when it detects a touch from the sensor registered to that script.[show live action shot of touching a sensor, and the action from the last step being repeated] 

We used record-and-replay to create an interactive music poster. [show 10 seconds of this]

For more robust control, Midas can send events over a WebSocket to a user-specified server. That server will then receive events from Midas describing which sensor was touched, its name, whether it is part of a pad or slider, and, if so, its position in the pad or slider. {sentence too long}

We used the websocket framework to prototype a version of Edgewrite on the backside of a smart phone; [show the edgewrite clip.]
