ghoti (pronounced "fish") is a small program designed to work with an Arduino connected to a serial port.

1. connect the Arduino to an MPR121 capacitive touch board
2. add some touch sensors to whatever you want (as long as it's not conductive!)
3. use Sikuli to create visual scripts
4. tie the scripts to the interactions via demonstration
5. repeat
6. watch your purdy interface make the sensors do everything you ever dreamed of!
