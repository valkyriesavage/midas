Midas Cu is exploring how to support designers in rapidly creating and
iterating on interaction ideas for objects.  We are moving increasingly
towards a world where we can print any object we dream of in any material
we like, and electronics and circuits should be no exception.  By using
some sheets of copper foil and vinyl along with a vinyl cutter and an Arduino,
the interface and components contained in this repository permits a person
to create capacitive touch sensors in any desired shape and affix them to any
object.  The "capturing" interface then allows them to "program" an action
on the computer by demonstrating it, which will then be parroted back on the
assigned trigger.

Components of the system:

codez/
  mpr_121/
    This directory contains code to be loaded onto an Arduino.
  midas_cu/
    This directory contains Java Swing code that makes the interface run.
paper/
  This directory contains the TeX source for the paper on Midas Cu.
