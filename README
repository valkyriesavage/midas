Touchit is a small program designed to work with an Arduino connected
to a serial port which communicates with a Java program.  It isn't done yet,
but when it is, the idea is this:

1. connect the Arduino to an MPR121 capacitive touch board
2. add some touch sensors
3. use the Java Robot-driven interface to assign those touch inputs
   to actions on-screen (e.g. typing, pressing buttons, opening programs...)
4. repeat
